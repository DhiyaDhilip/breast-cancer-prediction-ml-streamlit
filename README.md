# breast-cancer-prediction-ml-streamlit
Classification project for predicting breast cancer diagnosis using Random Forest. Includes EDA, feature scaling, accuracy-based evaluation, and deployment as a Streamlit web app. The trained model is saved using Joblib for reuse.

#  Breast Cancer Prediction Using Machine Learning

##  Project Overview
This project predicts whether a breast tumor is malignant or benign using supervised machine learning techniques applied to medical diagnostic data.
